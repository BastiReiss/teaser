    "main":  "CIVA, Vienna’s new media art festival, aims at strengthening the potential of artistic approaches in interaction with science, technology, and society. Under the title »Social Distancing – Virtual Bonding«, CIVA in 2021 explores the question of whether and how current technologies enable us to remain connected to each other on a virtual level in times of physical distance, or even to build new international networks and communities. For this purpose, CIVA – in view of the current situation of a worldwide pandemic – in 2021 particularly claims space in the virtual.  During the nine-day festival, various artistic and discursive formats will examine current media and recent technologies to see how they serve or harm our society – or in any case how they change it.
